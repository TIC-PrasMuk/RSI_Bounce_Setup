So, here's how to see this:
MS
M- BUP creation
W- MLC
D- CC trade
H- UT

MA
M- 20>50>200
W- Overspill rebound, so stabilization can happen too. 
D- BECO>200, so better to exit and let cycle align. 

RSI
M- RSI BUP at 60
W- Below 60, so it can take a hit at 60 and consolidate there, that can be stabilization.
D- Momentum
